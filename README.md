# Advanced Threat Detection System

## Description
This project is an Advanced Threat Detection System that uses machine learning to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) by analyzing network traffic and system logs.

## Skills
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Networking
- Log Analysis

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training
- Real-time threat detection

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-Threat-Detection-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Advanced-Threat-Detection-System/src
    ```
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
    ```
4. Preprocess the data:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
5. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
6. Detect threats:
    ```bash
    python detect_threats.py
    ```

## Usage
- Place your log files in the `logs/` directory.
- Run the scripts to preprocess data, train the model, and detect threats.
